Hi there ! 

I'm a joint PhD student in UMONS (Belgium) and Telecom SudParis (France) who discovered Machine Learning in 2017 throughout an internship in a start-up called Creaceed.

Since then, in addition to my engineering school, I took several MOOCS:

- Deeplearning.ai by Andrew Ng
- fast.ai by Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas that I now follow live


For more information, please take a look at my [resume](../cv.pdf)
